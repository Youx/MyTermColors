How to build MyTermColors
-------------------------

To build MyTermColors.bundle from source, you will need : 
- a Mac
- XCode
- iceberg (http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Iceberg.html) to create a pkg installer file
- dmgCanvas (http://www.araelium.com/dmgcanvas) to create a dmg containing the installer

Open the project file in XCode, then hit build.

This will create a MyTermColors.bundle in build/Release/
and (if you have the Iceberg and dmgCanvas) a pkg and a dmg in build/


How to install MyTermColors
---------------------------

To use MyTermColors, you will need to have SIMBL installed.
Grab it from here : http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php

Then, you just need to drop the MyTermColors.bundle into ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins

Or simply launch the installer and follow the instructions.
